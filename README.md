# Human Face, Cat Face & Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project is a real-time detection system that can identify **human faces**, **cat faces**, and **human eyes** using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. It demonstrates how machine learning and computer vision can be used to detect multiple facial features using pre-trained models.

#🚀 Features

- 👨‍🦰 Detects human faces in real-time
- 🐱 Detects cat faces using pre-trained Haar cascade
- 👁️ Detects human eyes within detected faces
- 📸 Real-time webcam feed using OpenCV
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight detection
- 🖥️ User-friendly terminal-based interface


# 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

# 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open all the files in your VS code or any other compiler you use and files should be in same folder.
2. Some test images are already provided here.
3. If you want to use your own image , then save the image in same folder where all the files are present.
4. Then, run 'aipro.py'.
5. Enter image name with extension [should only of type - .png, .jpg, .jpeg]
6. A new window will open and detect face and eyes.
7. Human face - green rectangle.
   Human eyes - red rectangle.
   Cat face - blue rectangle.
8. Enjoy it.
